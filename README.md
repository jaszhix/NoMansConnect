# DISCONTINUED

No Man's Sky no longer carries my interest, not enough time to maintain this, and too much modder drama. Maybe things will improve later.

# No Man's Connect

This is a location manager that syncs your current game's coordinates, uploads them to a server, and indexes a list of everyone's coordinates using the app. It also provides a map that plots your coordinates relative to the center of the galaxy.

This is currently needing more testing, so please back up your save files!

If you don't see other people's coordinates you will need to run the app as an administrator for now.

## Attribution

NMC uses Matthew Humphrey's [nmssavetool](https://github.com/matthew-humphrey/nmssavetool) for signing the save data, and the cheat menu functionality was ported to JS from it as well.

[monkeyman192](https://github.com/monkeyman192) provided the formula for transferring base data to different locations.

Thanks to both of them, the supporters that have helped out with server maintenance, and bug reporters! A list of contributors can be found in the app's About dialog.
